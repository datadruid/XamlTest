# XamlTest

This is a Xamarin Forms Project.

The developer should use XAML to create the page, all assets have already been added to the solution.

This test requires one screen to be created.

The PDF shows the screen before and after either the 'Practice' or the "Lesson" button has been pressed.

The Page displays with a google map background centered on the users current location (first image)

The Go button changes to green with a shadow when either the Practice or Lesson button is selected.

The selected button turns grey.

The other button (not selected)  border turns white and a shadow is added. (second Image)

The Google Maps API Key and Custom Formatting JSON are in the GoogleMaps Directory in the Project.
